# Notify Handler
A simple notify handler written for c++ & golang

Written for my own projects, but felt that it might have a home here.

There are examples of usage in each folder.

<b>Note:</b> The cpp version of this project contains fewer functions than it's golang counterpart and is more an error handler rather than a notifier.
